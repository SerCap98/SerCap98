### Hello, I'm Sergio Capon! 👋

🌎 I'm a passionate student of Computer Engineering in Venezuela, currently wrapping up my final year at the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello. My heart beats to the rhythm of code, and I love delving into the mysteries of software development.

💡 My focus extends to both sides of the spectrum: I'm equally intrigued by backend and frontend development, although my true passion lies in the robust and efficient crafting of server-side applications.

🛠️ I've explored various frameworks, from the mysteries of .NET and Nest to the wonders of Angular and Django. My language palette spans from C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, to TypeScript. The diversity of technologies has allowed me to develop a versatile approach and a set of interdisciplinary skills.

🚀 My journey in the world of software development has been exciting and ever-evolving, and I'm thrilled for what the future holds. Join me as we explore the fascinating world of code together!
